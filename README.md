Simple Meteor source code, started from the [Meteor tutorial](https://www.meteor.com/try). It just adds a color select (dropdown) item and colorization for tasks.

CSS select code is from [CSS Deck](http://cssdeck.com/labs/styling-select-box-with-css3).

It's also published on [the Meteor site](http://dk-todos.meteor.com/)
